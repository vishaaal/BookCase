      <p class="card-text">Norwegian Wood is a 1987 novel by Japanese author Haruki Murakami. The novel is a nostalgic story of loss and burgeoning sexuality. It is told from the first-person perspective of Toru Watanabe, who looks back on his days as a college student living in Tokyo. Through Watanabe's reminiscences, readers see him develop relationships with two very different women—the beautiful yet emotionally troubled Naoko, and the outgoing, lively Midori.

This novel is set in late 1960s Tokyo during a period when Japanese students, like those of many other nations, were protesting against the established order.</p>

              <p class="card-text">After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S.
                Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset.
                In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area
                of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities.
                People with a fixed mindset—those who believe that abilities are fixed—are less likely to flourish than
                those with a growth mindset—those who believe that abilities can be developed.

              <p class="card-text">The story of how a group of warriors, driven by faith, greed and wanderlust, carved out new Christian-ruled states in the Middle East is one of the most extraordinary of all epics. The crusaders' stunning initial success started a sequence of great Crusades, each with its own story, that fundamentally shaped the Christian and Muslim worlds for two centuries, until the last Crusader castles were finally expunged. The energy and commitment that sent army after army into the eastern Mediterranean also led to the invasion and conversion of Central and Baltic Europe, Spain, Portugal, the destruction of the Cathars in Provence and the settlement of America.</p>
