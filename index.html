                David Haskell s award-winning The Forest Unseen won acclaim for eloquent writing and deep engagement with the natural world. Now, Haskell brings his powers of observation to the biological networks that surround all species, including humans.
                Haskell repeatedly visits a dozen trees around the world, exploring the trees connections with webs of fungi, bacterial communities, cooperative and destructive animals, and other plants. An Amazonian ceibo tree reveals the rich ecological turmoil of the tropical forest, along with threats from expanding oil fields. Thousands of miles away, the roots of a balsam fir in Canada survive in poor soil only with the help of fungal partners. These links are nearly two billion years old: the fir s roots cling to rocks containing fossils of the first networked cells. </p>

                nostalgic story of loss and burgeoning sexuality. It is told from the first-person perspective of Toru
                Watanabe, who looks back on his days as a college student living in Tokyo. Through Watanabe's
                reminiscences, readers see him develop relationships with two very different women—the beautiful yet
                emotionally troubled Naoko, and the outgoing, lively Midori.

                This novel is set in late 1960s Tokyo during a period when Japanese students, like those of many other
                nations, were protesting against the established order.</p>

                <p class="card-text">After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S.
                  Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset.
                  In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area
                  of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities.
                  People with a fixed mindset—those who believe that abilities are fixed—are less likely to flourish than
                  those with a growth mindset—those who believe that abilities can be developed.
                  Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster
                  outstanding accomplishment.</p>

                crusaders' stunning initial success started a sequence of great Crusades, each with its own story, that
                fundamentally shaped the Christian and Muslim worlds for two centuries, until the last Crusader castles
                were finally expunged. The energy and commitment that sent army after army into the eastern
                Mediterranean also led to the invasion and conversion of Central and Baltic Europe, Spain, Portugal, the
                destruction of the Cathars in Provence and the settlement of America.</p>
