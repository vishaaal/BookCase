              <p class="card-text">After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S.
                Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset.
                In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area
                of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities.
                People with a fixed mindset—those who believe that abilities are fixed—are less likely to flourish than
                those with a growth mindset—those who believe that abilities can be developed.
                Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster
                outstanding accomplishment.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Autobiography of a Yogi is at once a beautifully written account of an exceptional
                life and
                a profound introduction to the ancient science of Yoga and its time-honored tradition of meditation.
                Profoundly inspiring, it is at the same time vastly entertaining, warmly humorous and filled with
                extraordinary personages.</p>

              <h5 class="card-title">The Complete Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</h5>
              <p class="card-text">“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.”He has no knowledge of literature, philosophy or astronomy. But his chemistry is strong, anatomy is explicit, remembers every horror committed in detail and is completely aware of the British Law.Meet Sherlock Holmes, the ruthless and self-disciplined detective who takes up every case as an intellectual challenge. He not only solves mysteries and discovers murderers, thieves and criminals, but also identifies the social injustices and provides a new and just approach to remedy them. A collection of twelve short stories, many of which were Doyle’s favorite, the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes was well received on its publication. Listed with the Guinness World Records as the ‘most portrayed movie character’ in history, Sherlock Holmes has been adapted numerous times and continues to remain a timeless detective.</p>
