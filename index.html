                <p class="card-text">After decades of research, world-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol S.
                  Dweck, Ph.D., discovered a simple but groundbreaking idea: the power of mindset.
                  In this brilliant book, she shows how success in school, work, sports, the arts, and almost every area
                  of human endeavor can be dramatically influenced by how we think about our talents and abilities.
                  People with a fixed mindset—those who believe that abilities are fixed—are less likely to flourish than
                  those with a growth mindset—those who believe that abilities can be developed.
                  Mindset reveals how great parents, teachers, managers, and athletes can put this idea to use to foster
                  outstanding accomplishment.</p>

                out new Christian-ruled states in the Middle East is one of the most extraordinary of all epics. The
                crusaders' stunning initial success started a sequence of great Crusades, each with its own story, that
                fundamentally shaped the Christian and Muslim worlds for two centuries, until the last Crusader castles
                were finally expunged. The energy and commitment that sent army after army into the eastern
                Mediterranean also led to the invasion and conversion of Central and Baltic Europe, Spain, Portugal, the
                destruction of the Cathars in Provence and the settlement of America.</p>
