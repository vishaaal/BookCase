# But what if I don't know how to add cards?

Not everyone is aware of every tool present in the world no matter how easy or complex it is. It's also not necessary to know each and every tool out there. Use the code sample below to add your own card for your favourite Book!

```html
<div class="col-lg-4 mb-4">
  <div class="card">
    <img class="card-img-top" src="[Link to Book image]" alt="" />
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">[Name of your favourite Book]</h5>
      <p class="card-text">[Small Description about your Book]</p>
      <a
        href="[Add the link to your GitHub Profile]"
        class="btn btn-outline-danger btn-sm"
        >Contributed by - [Add your GitHub Username/profile name]</a
      >
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Copy this code and paste it in the index.html file to make your changes. Test it on your own system and then create a pull request.
